00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Now my guest today is an extraordinary woman. The Ugandan climate activist Vanessa

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,760
Nakati began her activism back in 2019 by staging a solo climate protest at the gates of the Ugandan

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,280
parliament. Now she went on to co-found both the Rise Up movement and Fridays as well for

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,160
Future Uganda. She's currently here in Paris as part of a delegation of Ugandan and Tanzanian

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,520
activists fighting to drum up opposition to a huge oil pipeline which is under construction

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,360
in East Africa. Vanessa Nakati thanks very much for joining us on the program today. Let's start

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,920
off by talking about that oil pipeline. I mean it kind of sums up the kind of thing you're fighting

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,320
against. Tell us some what it is that you think is is wrong with it. Well first of all the East

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,960
Africa crude oil pipeline is you know it has already left thousands of people over 80,000

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:59,040
people displaced and this is a pipeline that is going to contribute to 34.3 million tons of

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,760
CO2 every year and this is a pipeline that is going to go through over 200 rivers. A third of

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,640
it is going to go through the Lake Victoria basin which is depended on by over 40 million people for

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,440
water and also for food. This pipeline is going to go through one of the oldest and you know

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,560
largest national parks in Uganda so it threatens the existence of the different species of animals

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,960
that call that place a home. So basically the pipeline is already causing so much harm

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,720
even before it is you know constructed. How do you counteract though? I mean obviously a lot of

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,360
people in Africa say the continent needs to develop and the way to develop is by building pipelines

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,920
like this. Inevitably that's going to lead to pollution but how can the continent kind of

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,560
develop and grow and take its real place within the world if things like this pipeline aren't

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,280
allowed? Well that's true. I really understand when people say that the continent needs to develop

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,640
and I also understand when people say these things are going to bring jobs or these things are going

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:17,200
to bring economic progress but you know we've seen how the extraction of oil in some African

23
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,160
countries has only left oil casks in these regions while the corporations that do these investments,

24
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,440
corporations from the global north, all they take is the profits and then they leave the oil spills

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,440
and the oil explosions for the people in those African nations. And the other thing you know

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,000
we've seen how much damage the fossil fuel industry has done to the planet and also to the people and

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,720
we cannot allow to you know develop in that same pattern. There is still a way to lift people out

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,800
of poverty. There is still a way to have you know good transportation energy but in a more sustainable

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,440
way. There is a need to transition to renewable energy but projects like ECOPE they actually push

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,040
African nations on the sidelines of a just transition as European countries or global

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,120
north countries are transitioning and you know fixing their nations. They are actually dumping

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,000
and you know transferring their emissions to nations like ours. Yeah you talk about global

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,520
companies. 24th of March, two days time, Total is publishing a report isn't it on its company's

34
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,640
strategy to try and achieve carbon neutrality. You're not very hopeful for what's going to come

35
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,160
out in that report are you? Well Total says it's going to go net zero by 2050 but it's still allowing

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,160
for more decades of environmental destruction. That is not climate leadership. You know that is

37
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,400
not climate action and that is not climate justice. Many times corporations like Total will put out

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,240
all these things but it is just greenwash. It is to show that they are transitioning and yet they

39
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,520
are continuing to harm communities like mine. There are people who are directly impacted by

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,600
this project who are still waiting for compensation for their land that was taken you know for over

41
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:13,040
two years now. So Total cannot talk about climate justice while it is destroying biodiversity,

42
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,560
ecosystems and displacing people in countries like mine. So do you think the world has got to

43
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,280
the point then where you can't have the two sitting side by side you can't have that development for

44
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,080
example of the oil industry and at the same time have the renewable energies happening at the same

45
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,640
time that the world needs to move completely towards renewable energy? Yeah I believe the

46
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,320
world needs to move completely to renewable energy. We've seen the harm you know that

47
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,720
fossil fuels has done to the world and it's very sad that those who are least responsible

48
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,240
you know for these emissions they're the ones suffering the most. You know the African continent

49
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,280
is responsible for less than four percent of global emissions but yet the people are already

50
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,040
suffering some of the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The floods, the cyclones, the droughts,

51
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,840
these are things that are already happening. So it is sad when you see that those who are

52
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,520
least responsible are being affected right now and while you know those who caused the climate

53
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,360
crisis they are easily you know transitioning their economies, transitioning their transportation

54
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,760
so it's much easier for them. That's why one of our demands is also climate finance. Climate finance

55
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:30,160
for nations you know that are vulnerable to the climate crisis. Climate finance for mitigation,

56
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,000
for adaptation and for loss and damage. The global north needs to let the global south

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,520
have a just transition. You spoke didn't you at the UN's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and you

58
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,240
spoke very passionately about the need to decolonise climate solutions in Africa. What do

59
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,800
you mean by that? Well not all climate solutions are actually climate justice. I could give some

60
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:01,440
examples. Many times we hear you know corporations talk about tree planting campaigns or re-afforestation

61
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,600
and afforestation campaigns but sometimes these campaigns mean that a certain indigenous community

62
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,200
is going to lose their land. You know certain people, certain societies are going to lose their

63
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,800
lands because of some of these projects so that is not climate justice. You will find that the

64
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,800
manufacturing of some of the electric vehicles will mean extreme violence and you know child

65
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,640
labour in certain communities that are you know being impacted already by the climate crisis.

66
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,480
So to me climate justice should not only involve the planet but it should also have the people at

67
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,400
hand. That is true climate justice because if it's just about climate solutions it will only be

68
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,640
climate action and not all climate action is climate justice. I want to talk a bit about you

69
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,080
as well. You're going to meet Pope Francis later today as part of your meeting here and you describe

70
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,080
yourself don't you as a born-again Christian. What is it you're hoping to get from that meeting as a

71
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,280
Christian but also as an activist as well? Well you know as a born-again Christian when I do my

72
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,480
activism you know it goes beyond just speaking for the planet. To me it's like protection of

73
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:20,160
God's creation and what God handed you know over to us, over to us to protect and to preserve and

74
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:28,080
to just multiply but not to exploit. So it's you know it's a great privilege for me to meet

75
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,720
one of the you know spiritual leaders in this world. I do honour spiritual leaders and it's a

76
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,200
great privilege that I will meet the Pope and I'm hoping to discuss with the Pope some of the issues

77
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,440
that are already impacting you know the lives of the people in my country and why we need not just

78
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,320
you know the leaders in the world but also spiritual leaders to stand with us for the planet.

79
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,560
And do you think that having that belief is what spurred you on as well to take you know the climate

80
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,160
message across the continent and across the world? Maybe it was actually there but I never realized

81
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,320
it from the beginning but when I started activism it was after seeing all these challenges that

82
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:17,120
people were already experiencing and I felt I had to do something about it. One thing that comes up

83
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,040
a lot often said you're often dubbed the African Greta Thunberg. How do you feel about that because

84
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,520
on the one hand it identifies you for people who don't know you but on the other hand it must be

85
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:42,000
slightly irritating I suppose. Well like what I can say is that my true identity is Vanessa Nakate.

86
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,960
That's all I can say. That's a good way of putting it. Yeah that is my true identity.

87
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,720
Yeah and is this something that you want to spend the rest of your life doing? Do you think this is

88
00:08:50,720 --> 00:09:01,040
your career now if you like? I'm not sure because when I started before starting activism I had

89
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,760
other plans as well and found myself doing activism so I would just continue with the

90
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,960
flow and see where the Lord continues to lead me. It's great to talk to you on the program today.

91
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,360
Thanks very much for coming in and talking to us. Vanessa Nakate there joining us here on

92
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
France 24. Thanks very much. You're welcome.

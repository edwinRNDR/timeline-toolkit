00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Now my guest today is an extraordinary woman. The Ugandan climate activist Vanessa

00:04.880 --> 00:11.760
Nakati began her activism back in 2019 by staging a solo climate protest at the gates of the Ugandan

00:11.760 --> 00:17.280
parliament. Now she went on to co-found both the Rise Up movement and Fridays as well for

00:17.280 --> 00:22.160
Future Uganda. She's currently here in Paris as part of a delegation of Ugandan and Tanzanian

00:22.160 --> 00:27.520
activists fighting to drum up opposition to a huge oil pipeline which is under construction

00:27.520 --> 00:33.360
in East Africa. Vanessa Nakati thanks very much for joining us on the program today. Let's start

00:33.360 --> 00:37.920
off by talking about that oil pipeline. I mean it kind of sums up the kind of thing you're fighting

00:37.920 --> 00:44.320
against. Tell us some what it is that you think is is wrong with it. Well first of all the East

00:44.320 --> 00:50.960
Africa crude oil pipeline is you know it has already left thousands of people over 80,000

00:50.960 --> 00:59.040
people displaced and this is a pipeline that is going to contribute to 34.3 million tons of

01:00.000 --> 01:07.760
CO2 every year and this is a pipeline that is going to go through over 200 rivers. A third of

01:07.760 --> 01:14.640
it is going to go through the Lake Victoria basin which is depended on by over 40 million people for

01:14.640 --> 01:21.440
water and also for food. This pipeline is going to go through one of the oldest and you know

01:21.440 --> 01:28.560
largest national parks in Uganda so it threatens the existence of the different species of animals

01:29.440 --> 01:36.960
that call that place a home. So basically the pipeline is already causing so much harm

01:36.960 --> 01:42.720
even before it is you know constructed. How do you counteract though? I mean obviously a lot of

01:42.720 --> 01:47.360
people in Africa say the continent needs to develop and the way to develop is by building pipelines

01:47.360 --> 01:51.920
like this. Inevitably that's going to lead to pollution but how can the continent kind of

01:51.920 --> 01:56.560
develop and grow and take its real place within the world if things like this pipeline aren't

01:56.560 --> 02:03.280
allowed? Well that's true. I really understand when people say that the continent needs to develop

02:03.280 --> 02:08.640
and I also understand when people say these things are going to bring jobs or these things are going

02:08.640 --> 02:17.200
to bring economic progress but you know we've seen how the extraction of oil in some African

02:17.200 --> 02:24.160
countries has only left oil casks in these regions while the corporations that do these investments,

02:24.160 --> 02:29.440
corporations from the global north, all they take is the profits and then they leave the oil spills

02:29.440 --> 02:35.440
and the oil explosions for the people in those African nations. And the other thing you know

02:35.440 --> 02:42.000
we've seen how much damage the fossil fuel industry has done to the planet and also to the people and

02:42.000 --> 02:48.720
we cannot allow to you know develop in that same pattern. There is still a way to lift people out

02:48.720 --> 02:54.800
of poverty. There is still a way to have you know good transportation energy but in a more sustainable

02:54.800 --> 03:01.440
way. There is a need to transition to renewable energy but projects like ECOPE they actually push

03:01.440 --> 03:07.040
African nations on the sidelines of a just transition as European countries or global

03:07.040 --> 03:13.120
north countries are transitioning and you know fixing their nations. They are actually dumping

03:13.120 --> 03:18.000
and you know transferring their emissions to nations like ours. Yeah you talk about global

03:18.000 --> 03:23.520
companies. 24th of March, two days time, Total is publishing a report isn't it on its company's

03:23.520 --> 03:28.640
strategy to try and achieve carbon neutrality. You're not very hopeful for what's going to come

03:28.640 --> 03:36.160
out in that report are you? Well Total says it's going to go net zero by 2050 but it's still allowing

03:36.160 --> 03:42.160
for more decades of environmental destruction. That is not climate leadership. You know that is

03:42.160 --> 03:48.400
not climate action and that is not climate justice. Many times corporations like Total will put out

03:48.400 --> 03:54.240
all these things but it is just greenwash. It is to show that they are transitioning and yet they

03:54.240 --> 03:59.520
are continuing to harm communities like mine. There are people who are directly impacted by

03:59.520 --> 04:05.600
this project who are still waiting for compensation for their land that was taken you know for over

04:05.600 --> 04:13.040
two years now. So Total cannot talk about climate justice while it is destroying biodiversity,

04:13.040 --> 04:18.560
ecosystems and displacing people in countries like mine. So do you think the world has got to

04:18.560 --> 04:23.280
the point then where you can't have the two sitting side by side you can't have that development for

04:23.280 --> 04:28.080
example of the oil industry and at the same time have the renewable energies happening at the same

04:28.080 --> 04:32.640
time that the world needs to move completely towards renewable energy? Yeah I believe the

04:32.640 --> 04:38.320
world needs to move completely to renewable energy. We've seen the harm you know that

04:38.320 --> 04:44.720
fossil fuels has done to the world and it's very sad that those who are least responsible

04:44.720 --> 04:50.240
you know for these emissions they're the ones suffering the most. You know the African continent

04:50.240 --> 04:55.280
is responsible for less than four percent of global emissions but yet the people are already

04:55.280 --> 05:01.040
suffering some of the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The floods, the cyclones, the droughts,

05:01.040 --> 05:05.840
these are things that are already happening. So it is sad when you see that those who are

05:05.840 --> 05:11.520
least responsible are being affected right now and while you know those who caused the climate

05:11.520 --> 05:17.360
crisis they are easily you know transitioning their economies, transitioning their transportation

05:17.360 --> 05:23.760
so it's much easier for them. That's why one of our demands is also climate finance. Climate finance

05:23.760 --> 05:30.160
for nations you know that are vulnerable to the climate crisis. Climate finance for mitigation,

05:30.160 --> 05:36.000
for adaptation and for loss and damage. The global north needs to let the global south

05:36.000 --> 05:41.520
have a just transition. You spoke didn't you at the UN's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and you

05:41.520 --> 05:46.240
spoke very passionately about the need to decolonise climate solutions in Africa. What do

05:46.240 --> 05:52.800
you mean by that? Well not all climate solutions are actually climate justice. I could give some

05:52.800 --> 06:01.440
examples. Many times we hear you know corporations talk about tree planting campaigns or re-afforestation

06:01.440 --> 06:07.600
and afforestation campaigns but sometimes these campaigns mean that a certain indigenous community

06:07.600 --> 06:13.200
is going to lose their land. You know certain people, certain societies are going to lose their

06:13.200 --> 06:18.800
lands because of some of these projects so that is not climate justice. You will find that the

06:18.800 --> 06:24.800
manufacturing of some of the electric vehicles will mean extreme violence and you know child

06:24.800 --> 06:30.640
labour in certain communities that are you know being impacted already by the climate crisis.

06:30.640 --> 06:36.480
So to me climate justice should not only involve the planet but it should also have the people at

06:36.480 --> 06:42.400
hand. That is true climate justice because if it's just about climate solutions it will only be

06:42.400 --> 06:48.640
climate action and not all climate action is climate justice. I want to talk a bit about you

06:48.640 --> 06:54.080
as well. You're going to meet Pope Francis later today as part of your meeting here and you describe

06:54.080 --> 06:58.080
yourself don't you as a born-again Christian. What is it you're hoping to get from that meeting as a

06:58.080 --> 07:05.280
Christian but also as an activist as well? Well you know as a born-again Christian when I do my

07:05.280 --> 07:12.480
activism you know it goes beyond just speaking for the planet. To me it's like protection of

07:12.480 --> 07:20.160
God's creation and what God handed you know over to us, over to us to protect and to preserve and

07:20.160 --> 07:28.080
to just multiply but not to exploit. So it's you know it's a great privilege for me to meet

07:28.080 --> 07:34.720
one of the you know spiritual leaders in this world. I do honour spiritual leaders and it's a

07:34.720 --> 07:41.200
great privilege that I will meet the Pope and I'm hoping to discuss with the Pope some of the issues

07:41.200 --> 07:47.440
that are already impacting you know the lives of the people in my country and why we need not just

07:47.440 --> 07:52.320
you know the leaders in the world but also spiritual leaders to stand with us for the planet.

07:52.320 --> 07:58.560
And do you think that having that belief is what spurred you on as well to take you know the climate

07:58.560 --> 08:04.160
message across the continent and across the world? Maybe it was actually there but I never realized

08:04.160 --> 08:10.320
it from the beginning but when I started activism it was after seeing all these challenges that

08:10.320 --> 08:17.120
people were already experiencing and I felt I had to do something about it. One thing that comes up

08:17.120 --> 08:23.040
a lot often said you're often dubbed the African Greta Thunberg. How do you feel about that because

08:23.760 --> 08:27.520
on the one hand it identifies you for people who don't know you but on the other hand it must be

08:27.520 --> 08:42.000
slightly irritating I suppose. Well like what I can say is that my true identity is Vanessa Nakate.

08:42.720 --> 08:46.960
That's all I can say. That's a good way of putting it. Yeah that is my true identity.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.720
Yeah and is this something that you want to spend the rest of your life doing? Do you think this is

08:50.720 --> 09:01.040
your career now if you like? I'm not sure because when I started before starting activism I had

09:01.040 --> 09:07.760
other plans as well and found myself doing activism so I would just continue with the

09:07.760 --> 09:12.960
flow and see where the Lord continues to lead me. It's great to talk to you on the program today.

09:12.960 --> 09:17.360
Thanks very much for coming in and talking to us. Vanessa Nakate there joining us here on

09:17.360 --> 09:21.120
France 24. Thanks very much. You're welcome.
